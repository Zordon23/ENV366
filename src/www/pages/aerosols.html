                <h1>Aerosols</h1>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Aerosols are minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. When these particles are sufficiently large, we notice their presence as they scatter and absorb sunlight. Their scattering of sunlight can reduce visibility (haze) and redden sunrises and sunsets.</p>
                    <p>Aerosols interact both directly and indirectly with the Earth's radiation budget and climate. As a direct effect, the aerosols scatter sunlight directly back into space. As an indirect effect, aerosols in the lower atmosphere can modify the size of cloud particles, changing how the clouds reflect and absorb sunlight, thereby affecting the Earth's energy budget.</p>
                    <p>Aerosols also can act as sites for chemical reactions to take place (heterogeneous chemistry). The most significant of these reactions are those that lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. During winter in the polar regions, aerosols grow to form polar stratospheric clouds. The large surface areas of these cloud particles provide sites for chemical reactions to take place. These reactions lead to the formation of large amounts of reactive chlorine and, ultimately, to the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere. Evidence now exists that shows similar changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations occur after major volcanic eruptions, like Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, where tons of volcanic aerosols are blown into the atmosphere.”</p>

                <p>There are three main types of Aerosols:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Volcanic Aerosols</li>
                    <li>Desert Dust</li>
                    <li>Human-Made Aerosols</li>

                    <p><b>Above:</b> “The dispersal of volcanic aerosols has a drastic effect on Earth's atmosphere. Follow an eruption, large amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrochloric acid (HCL) and ash are spewed into Earth's stratosphere. HCL, in most cases, condenses with water vapor and is rained out of the volcanic cloud formation. SO2 from the cloud is transformed into sulphuric acid, H2SO4. The sulphuric acid quickly condenses, producing aersol particles which linger in the atmosphere for long periods of time. The interaction of chemicals on the surface of aerosols, known as heterogeneous chemistry, and the tendency of aerosols to increase levels of chlorine gas react with nitrogen in the stratopshere, is a prime contributor to stratospheric ozone destruction."</p>

                <h2>Indirect Effect</h2>
                <p>Clouds form by condensation on preexisting aerosol particles (“cloud condensation nuclei”) when RH > 100%.</p>
                <h3>Clean Cloud (Few Particles): Large Cloud Droplets</h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/aerosols/diagram2.png"><br>
                <p>Clean clouds have a low albedo and efficient precipitation.</p>
                <h3>Polluted Cloud (Many Particles): Small Cloud Droplets</h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/aerosols/diagram3.png"><br>
                <p>Polluted clouds have a high albedo and suppressed precipitation.</p>
                <h2>Evidence of the Aerosol Indirect Effect</h2>
                <p>Particles emitted by ships increase the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).</p>
                <p>Increased CCN increases the concentration of cloud droplets and reduce their average size.</p>
                <p>Increased concentration and smaller particles reduce the production of drizzle.</p>
                <p>Liquid water content increases because the loss of drizzle particles is suppressed.</p>
                <p>Clouds are optically thicker and brighter along the ship track.</p>
