                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The rate of energy coming from the sun changes slightly day to day. Over many millennia in the Earth-Sun orbital relationship can change the geographical distribution of the sun’s energy over the Earth’s surface. It has been suggested that changes in solar output might affect our climate—both directly, by changing the rate of solar heating of the Earth and atmosphere, and indirectly, by changing cloud forming processes.</p>
                    <p>Over the time-scale of millions of years the change in solar intensity is a critical factor influencing climate (e.g., ice ages).  However, changes in solar heating rate over the last century cannot account for the magnitude and distribution of the rise in global mean temperature during that time period and there is no convincing evidence for significant indirect influences on our climate due to twentieth century changes in solar output.”</p>

                <h2>Total Solar Irradiance</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) is the rate at which energy from the sun reaches the top of Earth’s atmosphere. TSI fluctuates slightly from day to day and week to week. Superimposed on these rapid short-term fluctuations is a cycle related to sunspots in the outer layers of the Sun that lasts approximately every 11 years.”</p>

This composite, compiled by the VIRGO team at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium / World Radiation Center Davos, Switzerland, shows TSI as daily values plotted in different colors for the different originating experiments.

                <h2>Sunspots</h2>
                <p>The higher number of sunspots correlates to a higher intensity sun. Which means the more sunspots located on the sun, the more radiation the sun emits.</p>
                <h3>Annual Number of Sunspots 1700 - 1900</h3>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/solarcycle/diagram3.png"><br>
                <p>By comparing the two graphs pictured, looking at 1975-1990, the number of sunspots directly correlates to the Solar Irradiance. 1975 and 1985 recorded around 25 sunspots with a Solar Irradiance of about 1365.6, while 1980 and 1990 recorded around 150 sunspots with a Solar Irradiance of about 1366.6.</p>
                <h2>Solar Variations v. Twentieth Century Climate</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The rate at which solar energy reaches the Earth’s surface in any location depends on the season, time of day, cloudiness and the concentration of small aerosol particles in the atmosphere. During the late twentieth century, the average amount of solar energy reaching the surface decreased slightly due to atmospheric particles (aerosols), particularly in urban locations, that reflect the sun’s energy back into space. This pollution did not cause net global cooling because it was more than counteracted by the increasing concentrations of heat- trapping gases in the atmosphere (Greenhouse Effect).</p>
                    <p>In its Fourth Assessment Report, IPCC scientists evaluated simulations of twentieth century climate variables using a number of numerical models. They first assumed no increase in heat-trapping gases over this period, so that the temperatures calculated were those that would have been achieved if only solar variability, volcanic eruptions, and other natural climate drivers were included. The temperature results were similar to observed temperatures only for the first half of the century, but the models did not accurately show the general warming trend that has been recorded during the second half of the twentieth century. However, when the human-induced heat-trapping gases were included in the computer model, it accurately reproduced the observed warming during the twentieth century.</p>
                    <p>Thus, although fluctuations in the amount of solar energy reaching our atmosphere do influence our climate, the global warming trend of the past six decades cannot be attributed to changes in the sun.”</p>
